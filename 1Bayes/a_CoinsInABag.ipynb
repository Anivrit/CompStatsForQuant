    "1. Write out the mathematics for conditional probability and then elevating this to a Bayesian view of things\n",
    "2. Add in the likelihood to the `CoinFlip` class (is there a better way to define `nCr` (i.e. use an existing `scipy` function)\n",
    "3. Add in fucntionality to update multiple times and show that this gives the same results as before\n",
    "4. Show that we can use a non-uniform prior to show a belief and show how convergence time changes when we are sure and when we are unsure\n",
    "5. look at a cosomological model (or any other two parameter system)\n",

    "## 2. Elevating to probability distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now try and look at the same problem through the lens of probability distributions, to do this we need to define the prior, likelihood and posterior. \n",

    "### Prior, $\\pi (\\theta)$\n",
    "The prior distribution is a probability distribution of our prior beliefs of the parameters of the system before we've seen any data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of our two coins in a bag, the parameter of the model $\\theta$ is the *bias* of the coin we picked, $p$. Before actually flipping the coin, we believe there is an equal chance that we picked a coin with $p=0.5$ or $p=1$. This is known as a *uniform prior* as the probability distribution over the values of parameters in the model is uniform. We will look later at non-uniform priors and when to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Likelihood, $\\mathcal L(D | \\theta)$\n",
    "The likelihood describes how likely we are to observe some data, given the parameters of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case where we are flipping coins we notice that each flip has just two outcomes and therefore many flips will follow a [binomial distribution](#), having the formula for this binomial distribution becomes necessary for more non-trivial cases (i.e. $>2$ flips).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Posterior, $P(\\theta | D)$\n",
    "The posterior is the probability distribution over the model paramters which we get after updating the prior using our data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us an analogous expression for Bayes' rule for distributions:\n",

    "## 5. Piecewise uniform priors\n",
    "\n",
    "Having developed a full workflow for tackling problems with bayesian inference let's explore non-uniform priors i.e. before any data is seen we have an opinion on what the bias may be. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the case where Bob, hands you a coin and says *'this coin is biased towards tails, but remember I lie x% of the time'* (i.e. $0 < p < 0.5$ x% of the time and $0.5<p<1$ (100-x)% of the time).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can encode this by using a piecewise-uniform prior\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\pi =  \n",
    "\\begin{cases} \n",
    "x/0.5, \\qquad 0 < p < 0.5 \\\\\n",
    "(1-x)/0.5, \\quad 0.5 < p < 1\n",
    "\\end{cases}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now lets repeat the above analysis using bayesian updating for a dataset consisting of 5 sets of 10 flips. In the first case, Bob wasn't lying and $p_\\text{true} = 0.25$. In the second case, Bob was lying and $p_\\text{true} = 0.75$. \n",
    "\n",
    "As expected when Bob isn't lying our graph converges towards $p_\\text{true}$ normally. Interestingly, when Bob is lying, although after all 5 sets of flips the posterior looks closely matches that to when Bob is telling the truth. For the first and second posterior we get a bimodal distribution meaning we are not sure about whether to trust our data or our prior. \n",
    "\n",
    "This shows that for sparse data regimes, the choice of prior is important but for regimes where there is lots of data it is much less important. "
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "The two interesting cases to look at are when our prior guess is right, such that $p_{\\mu} \\approx p_{\\text{true}}$ and when our prior is very wrong, so we have been tricked and were given a coin with bias very different to what we thought. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Non_Uniform_Bayes](figs/non_uniform.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the bottom graph we see when our prior is right, each of the updated posteriors rapidly converges to the true value, with a more spiked (confident) distribution. However, when we have been tricked and our prior is very wrong, the posteriors are 'dragged' away from our prior as more and more data flows in. This reflects the balance between our initial opinion that a coin with $p_{\\text{true}}=0.1$ is very unlikely, combined with the fact that we keep flipping tails over and over. It is interesting to see that even for only $N=100$ flips total, the posterior has moved significantly away from the initial prior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing a good prior can become very important when working with more complicated models. For example, in a 100-dimensional bayesian inference, the volume of posterior space to explore becomes huge and the process of converging our prior onto the true posterior becomes exponentially slower. Therefore choosing a prior which is accurate can drastically reduce the amount of data and computational resources required."
